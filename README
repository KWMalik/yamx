             YAMX - Yet another management extension
=====================================================================

This project aims at providing cross-platform management extension
that can be used primarily for monitoring health of applications and
for viewing some vital stats.

It will have 2 parts:

1. YAMX Server - A web app that displays status of all the registered apps.
2. YAMX Agent - An agent that runs within the apps and periodically publishes
                heartbeat and vital stats to server



Pre-requisites:
1. rvm
2. ruby 1.9.2 or jruby 1.6+
3. sqlite
	sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

4. Bundler gem
5. Run "bundle install" to get other dependency gems.
