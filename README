             YAMX - Yet another management extension
=====================================================================

This project aims at providing cross-platform management extension
that can be used primarily for monitoring health of applications and
for viewing some vital stats.

It will have 2 parts:

1. YAMX Server - A web app that displays status of all the registered apps.
2. YAMX Agent - An agent that runs within the apps and periodically publishes
                heartbeat and vital stats to server
